# Homework 8 - Collaboration

This week homework, required you to work in group, each member in the group must contribute something to the work.

Your group should setup a git-repository for this week homework, each group is responsible to solve the 5 exercises listed below.

How individual handle each exercise should be up to your group to decide. However, to show your contribution, you must use pull-request feature on git-hub to merge your answer with other group member.

Example:

Answer to each exercise to located on a separated file, naming ex: exercise-1.py, exercise-2.py â€¦ etc.

To submit this week homework, please copy your group week 6 homework github repository and paste as a url submission

**Note: only 1 member in the group require to submit this exercise.**

### Group Responsibility

<u>Group Leader</u>

1. Clone the repository from your group leader
2. Change the clone repository origin to the one that you just created [how to set new origin on clone directory](https://github.com/joechea-aupp/github_tut)
3. Approve your member pull request.
4. Submit your group repository url on Canvas

<u>Group Member</u>

1. Fork [this](https://github.com/joechea-aupp/homework_8_collab) repository
2. Solve exercise that's assigned to you
3. Merge your answer with the origin repository

### Exercise 1 - **2pts**

In a given list the last element should become the first one. An empty list or list with only one element should stay the same

![m3](resources/image_2023-07-28_11-34-30.png)

Example:
replace_last([2, 3, 4, 1]) == [1, 2, 3, 4]
replace_last([1, 2, 3, 4]) == [4, 1, 2, 3]
replace_last([1]) == [1]
replace_last([]) == []

### Exercise 2 - **2pts**

You are given an array with positive numbers and a number N. You should find the N-th power of the element in the array with the index N. If N is outside of the array, then return -1. Don't forget that the first element has the index 0.

Let's look at a few examples:

- array = [1, 2, 3, 4] and N = 2, then the result is 3 2 == 9;
- array = [1, 2, 3] and N = 3, but N is outside of the array, so the result is -1.

Input: Two arguments. An array as a list of integers and a number as a integer.

Output: The result as an integer.

Example:

```
index_power([1, 2, 3, 4], 2) == 9
index_power([1, 3, 10, 100], 3) == 1000000
index_power([0, 1], 0) == 1
index_power([1, 2], 3) == -1

```

### Exercise 3 - **2pts**

Not all of the elements are important. What you need to do here is to remove all of the elements after the given one from list.

![m3](resources/image_2023-07-28_11-36-13.png)

For illustration, we have an list [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] and we need to remove all the elements that go after 3 - which is 4 and 5.

We have two edge cases here: (1) if a cutting element cannot be found, then the list shouldn't be changed; (2) if the list is empty, then it should remain empty.

Input: List and the border element.

Output: Iterable (list).

Example:

```
remove_all_after([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], 3) == [1, 2, 3]
remove_all_after([1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3], 2) == [1, 1, 2]

```

### Exercise 4 - 2pts

You have a lot of work to do, so you might want to split it into smaller pieces. This way you'll know which piece you'll do on Monday, which will be for Tuesday and so on.

Split a list into smaller lists of the same size (chunks). The last chunk can be smaller than the default chunk-size. If the list is empty, then you shouldn't have any chunks at all.

![m4](resources/image_2023-07-28_11-37-25.png)

Input: Two arguments. A List and chunk size.

Output: An Iterable with chunked Iterable.

Example:

```
chunking_by([5, 4, 7, 3, 4, 5, 4], 3) == [[5, 4, 7], [3, 4, 5], [4]]
chunking_by([3, 4, 5], 1) == [[3], [4], [5]]

```

ref: https://py.checkio.org/en/mission/chunk/Links

### Exercise 5 - 2pts

Create and return a new Iterable that contains the same elements as the given list items, but with the reversed order of the elements inside every maximal strictly ascending subsequence. This function should not modify the contents of the original list.

Input: List of integers (int).

Output: List or another Iterable (tuple, iterator, generator) of integers (int).

Examples:

```
assert list(reverse_ascending([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])) == [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
assert list(reverse_ascending([5, 7, 10, 4, 2, 7, 8, 1, 3])) == [
    10,
    7,
    5,
    4,
    8,
    7,
    2,
    3,
    1,
]
assert list(reverse_ascending([5, 4, 3, 2, 1])) == [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
assert list(reverse_ascending([])) == []
1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
10
11
12
13
14
```

How it is used: (math is used everywhere)

Precondition: given sequence includes only integers.
